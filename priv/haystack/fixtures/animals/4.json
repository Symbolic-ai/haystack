  "description": "The king cobra is a venomous snake found in the forests and grasslands of Southeast Asia. It is the longest venomous snake in the world and is known for its distinctive hood, which it expands when threatened. King cobras primarily feed on other snakes, but will also eat lizards, birds, and rodents. They are solitary and generally avoid humans, but their venom can be deadly and they are considered a significant threat to humans in their native range. The species is threatened by habitat loss and collection for the pet trade."
