  "description": "The blue whale is the largest animal on earth, with an average length of 25-30 meters and weight of 100-200 tons. They are found in all of the world's oceans and are known for their distinctive blue-gray coloration and mottled appearance. Blue whales are filter feeders, feeding on small crustaceans called krill, and can consume up to 4 tons of krill per day. They are threatened by hunting, climate change, and ocean pollution."
